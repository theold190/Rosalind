Rosalind
========

A set of solutions for tasks from Rosalind project using Python.

I use Rosalind project for learning Python and refreshing my knowledge of 
different algorithms. At this moment up to 28 problems are solved. The 
one I have most struggle is REAR, the last I was working on is EDTA.

I enjoyed solving those problems very much and encorage you to try it 
yourself. And to keep process of discovery a bit more exciting for now I 
don't publish my solutions.
